// silversrc is NOT affliated with Goldsrc, Valve or anything related to valve
// or steam, this is me trying to learn C by trying to make a goldsrc clone,
// Silversrc is designed to be a clone of goldsrc, and make any goldsrc/hl1 game work well, albeit with some bugs and glitches
// Roadmap, (c) SilverSrc Developers 2025-2025

// Wad3 Support (Investigating, for now, will be done after memory conchars is completed)
// ttf font in console (Replaced with Memory Conchars, not being done)
// Reasons why ttf support was scrapped: it was very hard and i decided to scrap it
// Memory Conchars (90% Done)
// Vgui (later, not a priority)
// BSP v30 (Investigating, also will be done after wad3 support)
// NPC and Entites (Investigating, will be done after BSP v30 support)
// Compatibility with Stuff like CS 1.6 or below (Also not a priority)
